# Advanced Python Calculator for Software Engineering Graduate Course

## Project Overview

This midterm requires the development of an advanced Python-based calculator application. Designed to underscore the importance of professional software development practices, the application integrates clean, maintainable code, the application of design patterns, comprehensive logging, dynamic configuration via environment variables, sophisticated data handling with Pandas, and a command-line interface (REPL) for real-time user interaction.

## Project Submission

- Create a NEW repository from scratch and transfer any relevant work as you complete the assignment, **you need to show a clear history of work through your commits, or your project could be given as low as a 0 for not showing your work.**
- Submit through a GitHub repository link containing the necessary documentation, configuration examples, and a coherent commit history.
- You are required to write a short description and link to your implememtation of the design patterns you use.
- You need to provide a description of how you used environment variables and link to your code to illustrate.
-  You need to explain and link to how you are using logging.
-  You need to link to and explain how you are using try/catch / exceptions to illustrate  "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) and "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP)/
- Create a 3-5 minute video demonstration of using the calculator, highlighting its key features and functionalities. Link the video to the repository readme.
-  Submit a link to your repository to Canvas.  
-  Keep your repository private while working on it, so people don't copy your work.  Make the repository public within a day of the project being due, so we can grade it.
- **REQUIRED - YOU MUST USE GITHUB ACTIONS AND YOUR CODE MUST PASS ALL THE TESTS ON GITHUB**
