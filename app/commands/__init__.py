'''
Class CommandHandler acts as the invoker. It stores commands and knows how to execute them 
based on user input. 
An empty dictionary commands is the constructor method. Maps command names to command objects.
register_command: registers a command with a name.
execute_command: takes a single string from user input to parse, find correct command, 
converts arguments to Decimal, and runs the command.
